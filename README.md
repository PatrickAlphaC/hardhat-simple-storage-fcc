# Hardhat Simple Storage

This is a section of the Javascript Blockchain/Smart Contract FreeCodeCamp Course.

*[⌨️ (08:20:17) Lesson 6: Hardhat Simple Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&t=30017s)*

*This repo has been updated for Sepolia over Goerli.*

## Hardhat Installation Instructions

We recommend using npm 7 or later. If you do that, then you just need to install the plugin itself:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```
If you are using an older version of npm, you'll also need to install all the packages used by the toolbox.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan chai ethers hardhat-gas-reporter solidity-coverage @typechain/hardhat typechain @typechain/ethers-v5 @ethersproject/abi @ethersproject/providers
```
That's also the case if you are using yarn:

```bash
yarn add --dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan chai ethers hardhat-gas-reporter solidity-coverage @typechain/hardhat typechain @typechain/ethers-v5 @ethersproject/abi @ethersproject/providers
```

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - `node --version` and get an output like: `vx.x.x`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) instead of `npm`
  - You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
    - `yarn --version` and get an output like: `x.x.x`
    - You might need to [install it with `npm`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) or `corepack`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-simple-storage-fcc
cd hardhat-simple-storage-fcc
yarn
yarn hardhat
```

## Typescript

For the typescript edition, run:

```
git checkout typescript
```

### Optional Gitpod

If you can't or don't want to run and install locally, you can work with this repo in Gitpod. If you do this, you can skip the `clone this repo` part.

# Usage

Deploy:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Testing

```
npx hardhat test
```

### Test Coverage

```
npx hardhat coverage
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
npx hardhat test
```

And you'll see and output file called `gas-report.txt`

## Local Deployment 

If you'd like to run your own local hardhat network, you can run:

```
npx hardhat node
```

And then **in a different terminal**

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

And you should see transactions happen in your terminal that is running `npx hardhat node`

### Important localhost note

If you use metamask with a local network, everytime you shut down your node, you'll need to reset your account. Settings -> Advanced -> Reset account. Don't do this with a metamask you have real funds in. And maybe don't do this if you're a little confused by this. 

## Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

2. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

3. Deploy

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

### Verify on etherscan

If you deploy to a testnet or mainnet, you can verify it if you get an [API Key](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) from Etherscan and set it as an environment variable named `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`. You can pop it into your `.env` file as seen in the `.env.example`.

In it's current state, if you have your api key set, it will auto verify sepolia contracts!

However, you can manual verify with:

```
npx hardhat verify --constructor-args arguments.js DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

# Linting

To check linting / code formatting:
```
yarn lint
```
or, to fix: 
```
